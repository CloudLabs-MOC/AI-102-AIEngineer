# Exercise 01: Get Started with Azure AI Services

## Lab scenario

In this exercise, you'll get started with Azure AI Services by creating an **Azure AI Services** resource in your Azure subscription and using it from a client application. The goal of the exercise is not to gain expertise in any particular service, but rather to become familiar with a general pattern for provisioning and working with Azure AI services as a developer.

## Objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

+ Task 1: Open the cloned folder in Visual Studio Code
+ Task 2: Provision an Azure AI Services resource
+ Task 3: Use a REST Interface
+ Task 4: Use an SDK

## Estimated timing: 45 minutes

    ![Visual Studio Code Icon](./images/a-8.png)

    >**Note:** On the **Do you trust the authors of the files in this folder?** pop-up, select **Yes, I trust the authors**.

    >**Note:** You may be prompted to complete a 2-minute survey. Go ahead and select **No, thanks**. You may need to do this more than once.

## Task 2: Provision an Azure AI Services resource

Azure AI Services are cloud-based services that encapsulate artificial intelligence capabilities you can incorporate into your applications. You can provision individual Azure AI services resources for specific APIs (for example, **Language** or **Vision**), or you can provision a single **Azure AI Services** resource that provides access to multiple Azure AI services APIs through a single endpoint and key. In this case, you'll use a single **Azure AI Services** resource.

1. Navigate to the **Azure Portal**.

    ![Visual Studio Code Icon](./images/azureportal.png)

1. In the top search bar, search for **Azure AI services (1)**, select **Azure AI Services (2)**.

    ![Visual Studio Code Icon](./images/a-2.png)

1. On the **Azure AI service** home page, from the left navigation menu, select **Azure AI services multi-service account (1)**, select **+ Create (2)**.

    ![Visual Studio Code Icon](./images/a-3.png)

1. Create the resource with the following settings, then click on **Review+Create (7)**
    
    - **Subscription**: **Your Azure subscription (1)**
    
    - **Resource group**: **ai-102-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/> (2)**
    
    - **Region**: **Choose any available region (3)**
    
    - **Name**: **azureai<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/> (4)**
    
    - **Pricing tier**: **Standard S0 (5)**

    - **By checking this box I acknowledge that I have read and understood all the terms below**: Select the checkbox **(6)**

      ![Visual Studio Code Icon](./images/a-4.png)    

1. Once the validation passed, select **Create**.

1. Wait for deployment to complete, and then view the deployment details.

1. Select **Go to resource**.

    ![Visual Studio Code Icon](./images/a-5.png)

1. From the left navigation menu, select **Keys and Endpoint (1)** under **Resource management**. This page contains the information that you will need to connect to your resource and use it from applications you develop. Specifically:
    
    - An HTTP **Endpoint** to which client applications can send requests.
    
    - Two **Keys** that can be used for authentication (client applications can use either key to authenticate).
    
    - The *location* where the resource is hosted. This is required for requests to some (but not all) APIs.

      >**Note:** Copy the values of **Endpoint (3)** and **Key 1 (2)**, in a notepad. You will use this in the next task.

## Task 3: Use a REST Interface

The Azure AI services APIs are REST-based, so you can consume them by submitting JSON requests over HTTP. In this example, you'll explore a console application that uses the **Language** REST API to perform language detection; but the basic principle is the same for all of the APIs supported by the Azure AI services resource.

1. Open Visual Studio Code, in the **Explorer (1)** pane, browse to the **01-getting-started (2)** folder and expand the **C-Sharp (3)** folder.

    ![Visual Studio Code Icon](./images/a-9.png)

1. View the contents of the **rest-client** folder, and note that it contains a file for configuration settings:
    
    - **C#**: **appsettings.json (1)**

1. Open the configuration file and update the configuration values it contains to reflect the **endpoint (2)** and an authentication **key (3)** for your Azure AI services resource that you had copied earlier. **Save your changes**, by pressing **CTRL + S** on the keyboard.

    ![Visual Studio Code Icon](./images/a-10.png)

1. Note that the **rest-client** folder contains a code file for the client application:

    - **C#**: **Program.cs (1)**

1. Open the code file and review the code it contains, the following details:
    
    - Various namespaces are imported to enable HTTP communication
    
    - Code in the **Main (2)** function retrieves the endpoint and key for your Azure AI services resource - these will be used to send REST requests to the Text Analytics service.

      ![Visual Studio Code Icon](./images/a-11.png)    
    
    - The program accepts user input, and uses the **GetLanguage** function to call the Text Analytics language detection REST API for your Azure AI services endpoint to detect the language of the text that was entered.
    
    - The request sent to the API consists of a JSON object containing the input data - in this case, a collection of **document** objects, each of which has an **id** and **text**.

      ![Visual Studio Code Icon](./images/a-12.png)        
    
    - The key for your service is included in the request header to authenticate your client application.
    
    - The response from the service is a JSON object, which the client application can parse.

1. Right-click on the **rest-client (1)** folder and **Open an integrated terminal (2)**. Then enter the following language-specific command to run the program:

    ![Visual Studio Code Icon](./images/a-13.png)

    **C#**

    ```
    dotnet run
    ```

1. When prompted, enter some text and review the language that is detected by the service, which is returned in the JSON response. For example, try entering "**Hello**", "**Bonjour**", and "**Hola**".

    ![Visual Studio Code Icon](./images/a-14.png)

1. When you have finished testing the application, enter "**quit**" to stop the program.

## Task 4: Use an SDK

You can write code that consumes Azure AI services REST APIs directly, but there are software development kits (SDKs) for many popular programming languages, including Microsoft C#, Python, and Node.js. Using an SDK can greatly simplify development of applications that consume Azure AI services.

1. In Visual Studio Code, in the **Explorer (1)** pane, in the **01-getting-started (2)** folder, expand the **C-Sharp (3)** folder. Right-click the **sdk-client (4)** folder and then select **Open an integrated terminal (5)**.

    ![Visual Studio Code Icon](./images/a-15.png)

1. Then install the Text Analytics SDK package by running the appropriate command for your language preference:

    **C#**

    ```
    dotnet add package Azure.AI.TextAnalytics --version 5.3.0
    ```

1. View the contents of the **sdk-client** folder, and note that it contains a file for configuration settings:
    
    - **C#**: **appsettings.json (1)**

1. Open the configuration file and update the configuration values it contains to reflect the **endpoint (2)** and an authentication **key (3)** for your Azure AI services resource that you had copied earlier. **Save your changes**.

    ![Visual Studio Code Icon](./images/a-16.png)
    
1. Note that the **sdk-client** folder contains a code file for the client application:

    - **C#**: **Program.cs**

1. Open the code file and review the code it contains, noting the following details:
    
    - The namespace for the SDK you installed is imported
    
    - Code in the **Main** function retrieves the endpoint and key for your Azure AI services resource - these will be used with the SDK to create a client for the Text Analytics service.

      ![Visual Studio Code Icon](./images/a-17.png)        
    
    - The **GetLanguage** function uses the SDK to create a client for the service, and then uses the client to detect the language of the text that was entered.

      ![Visual Studio Code Icon](./images/a-18.png)        

1. Return to the integrated terminal for the **sdk-client** folder, and enter the following command to run the program:

    **C#**

    ```
    dotnet run
    ```

1. When prompted, enter some text and review the language that is detected by the service. For example, try entering "**Goodbye**", "**Au revoir**", and "**Hasta la vista**".

    ![Visual Studio Code Icon](./images/a-19.png)

1. When you have finished testing the application, enter "**quit**" to stop the program.

    > **Note**: Some languages that require Unicode character sets may not be recognized in this simple console application.
